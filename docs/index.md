# Lutra Starter Documentation

Hello there! You're using the Lutra starter documentation template,
which is designed to help you get started with writing your
documentation.

The starter provides three things:

- Basic Sphinx configuration, written in a maintainable style.
- Markdown support enabled through [MyST-parser].
- Configuration for ReadTheDocs.
